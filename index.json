What are the unimportant features and patterns, and how can I effectively minimize their visual impact? Can I hide them altogether? How dense (or sparse) is my data? What data resolution is required? Can I bin the data, or show summary statistics instead of the data (e.g. min/avg/max)? What is the length scale of significant variation and non-signficant noise? In what media will the figure be shown? How does the resolution of the media compare to the resolution of my data? Do I have the time/energy/motivation to worry about black-and-white reproduction or readers with color blindness? Circos is a software package for visualizing data and information. It visualizes data in a circular layout — this makes Circos ideal for exploring relationships between objects or positions. There are other reasons why a circular layout is advantageous, not the least being the fact that it is attractive. Circos is ideal for creating publication-quality infographics and illustrations with a high data-to-ink ratio, richly layered data and pleasant symmetries. You have fine control each element in the figure to tailor its focus points and detail to your audience. Circos is flexible. Although originally designed for visualizing genomic data, it can create figures from data in any field—from genomics to visualizing migration to mathematical art. If you have data that describes relationships or multi-layered annotations of one or more scales, Circos is for you. Circos can be automated. It is controlled by plain-text configuration files, which makes it easily incorporated into data acquisition, analysis and reporting pipelines (a data pipeline is a multi-step process in which data is analyzed by multiple and typically independent tools, each passing their output as the input to the next step). Before download and install Circos, you need to understand the requirements. If you are a Windows user, read about pertinent differences between UNIX and Windows. To learn how to use Circos, free tutorials are also available online. Alternatively, you can click here and scroll down to the bottom to download the tutorials, which contain many examples to demonstrate features of Circos.\nScreen shot of Circos website Apart from Circos, an R package named circlize can help you as well. The circlize package was developed by Zuguang GU etc. and published on Bioinformatics and is free available on PubMed.

It is designed for finding all the places in a reference genome where each sequence may come from. This task is essential to the analysis of data from ultra high-throughput sequencing machines. With a carefully designed index-filtering algorithm and an efficient implementation, SeqMap can map tens of millions of short sequences to a genome of several billions of nucleotides. Multiple substitutions and insertions/deletions of the nucleotide bases in the sequences can be tolerated and therefore detected. SeqMap supports FASTA input format and various output formats, and provides command line options for tuning almost every aspect of the mapping process. A typical mapping can be done in a few hours on a desktop PC. Parallel use of SeqMap on a cluster is also very straightforward.\nDownload SeqMap from official website.\nDownload Research Article from Bioinformatics or PubMed.\nClick to see all similiar articles on PubMed.\nClick to see all “Cited by” articles on PubMed.\n\u0026lt; Back to Softwares Alternative to Online Resources ","date":1666742400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666742400,"objectID":"78f9a5255e9cb312afa79c2078a12b2e","permalink":"https://lbmii.github.io/resources/softwares/seqmap/","publishdate":"2022-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/softwares/seqmap/","section":"resources","summary":"SeqMap is a tool for mapping large amount of oligonucleotide to the genome.\n","tags":null,"title":"A tool for mapping short sequences to the genome","type":"resources"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Books","Programming","Markdown"],"content":"A simple way to format text, and turn your analyses into high quality files of various types.\nR Markdown is a powerful tool for combining analysis and reporting into the same document. Since the birth of the rmarkdown package in early 2014, R Markdown has grown substantially from a package that supports a few output formats, to an extensive and diverse ecosystem that supports the creation of books, blogs, scientific articles, websites, and even resumes.\nYour data tells a story. R Markdown helps to turn your analyses into high quality documents, reports, presentations and dashboards. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible. Use a productive notebook interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. Use multiple languages including R, Python, and SQL. R Markdown supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats including HTML, PDF, MS Word, Beamer, HTML5 slides, Tufte-style handouts, books, dashboards, shiny applications, scientific articles, websites, and more.\nThere is a wealth of guidance that has been written over the past few years, and the book R Markdown: The Definitive Guide provides a detailed reference on the built-in R Markdown output formats of the rmarkdown package, as well as several other extension packages. This book has been published by Chapman \u0026amp; Hall/CRC and the online version of this book is free to read clicking here.\nR Markdown: The Definitive Guide Despite the existence of the official documentation, R Markdown users often seek help on Stack Overflow, a popular Q\u0026amp;A forum. Authors have received comments from our readers and publisher that it would be beneficial to provide more practical and relatively short examples to show the interesting and useful usage of R Markdown, because it can be daunting to find out how to achieve a certain task from the aforementioned reference book (put another way, that book is too dry to read). As a result, R Markdown Cookbook was born. This book is designed to provide a range of examples on how to extend the functionality of your R Markdown documents. As a cookbook, this guide is recommended to new and intermediate R Markdown users who desire to enhance the efficiency of using R Markdown and also explore the power of R Markdown. The online version of R Markdown Cookbook is also free.\nR Markdown Cookbook The book, bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown, introduces an R package, bookdown, to change your workflow of writing books. It should be technically easy to write a book, visually pleasant to view the book, fun to interact with the book, convenient to navigate through the book, straightforward for readers to contribute or leave feedback to the book author(s), and more importantly, authors should not always be distracted by typesetting details. The bookdown package is built on top of R Markdown, and inherits the simplicity of the Markdown syntax, as well as the possibility of multiple types of output formats (PDF/HTML/Word/…). It has also added features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, inserting parts/appendices, and imported the GitBook style to create elegant and appealing HTML book pages. This book itself is an example of how you can produce a book from a series of R Markdown documents, and both the printed version and the online version can look professional.\nbookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown Blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown teaches you how to create websites using R Markdown and Hugo. If you have experience with creating websites, you may naturally ask what the benefits of using R Markdown are, and how blogdown is different from existing popular website platforms, such as WordPress. There are two major highlights of blogdown:\nIt produces a static website, meaning the website only consists of static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, etc. You can host the website on any web server. The website does not require server-side scripts such as PHP or databases like WordPress does. It is just one folder of static files. More benefits of static websites are discussed at length in blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown when authors introduce the static website generator Hugo.\nThe website is generated from R Markdown documents. This brings a huge amount of benefits, especially if your website is related to data analysis or (R) programming. Being able to use Markdown implies simplicity and more importantly, portability (e.g., you are giving yourself the chance to convert your blog posts to PDF and publish to journals or even books in the future).

Currently, a huge number of circRNAs was already identified from high-throughput RNA-seq data sets. However, functional annotation and prioritization of these circRNAs for further expreimental validation as well as functional investigation is the bottleneck step for current circRNA studies. Now, we developed a new resource database and web tool named circAtlas that integrated over one millions of circRNAs across 6 species (human, macaca, mouse, rat, pig, chicken) and a variety of tissues. The circAtlas can fill this gap by integrating the most comprehensive circRNAs and their expression and functional profiles in vertebrates, which provides a foundation for circRNA studies and serves as a powerful starting point to investigate their biological significance.\nexoRBase is a repository of extracellular vesicles (EVs) long RNAs (exLRs) derived from RNA-seq data analyses in different human body fluids.

As a biological information platform for circRNAs, CircFunBase will contribute for circRNA studies and bridge the gap between circRNAs and their functions.\nHigh-throughput genomic technologies like ChIP-seq and RNA-seq become more and more mature and inexpensive. A large number of circular RNAs (circRNAs) from back-spliced exons have been identified in various cell lines and across different species. However, transcriptional regulatory function of abundant circRNAs is unclear, so building a database of transcriptional regulatory information of circRNA is necessary. Here, based on ChIP-seq peaks of transcription factors binding sites (TFBSs) of each cell lines from ENCODE and all annotated human circRNAs from circBase, we developed a data source titled “TRCirc”, where enriched regions of TFBSs (peaks) from ChIP-seq experiments crossed with the regulatory region of circRNAs by their genomic coordinates, if a TFBS is located within the regulatory region of a certain circRNA, they form a TF and circRNA regulatory relationship …","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"b6b7ff1b70f5d5fe9366e0155a907fc3","permalink":"https://lbmii.github.io/resources/database/circdb/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/database/circdb/","section":"resources","summary":"","tags":["Circular RNAs"],"title":"Web resources for functional studies of circular RNAs","type":"resources"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Books","Tutorials","Programming"],"content":"Advanced R is a book in Chapman \u0026amp; Hall’s R Series.

And it is one part of DIANA suites. Actually, DIANA provides several powerful tools facilitating your analysis.\nmiRDB is an online database for miRNA target prediction and functional annotations. All the targets in miRDB were predicted by a bioinformatics tool, MirTarget, which was developed by analyzing thousands of miRNA-target interactions from high-throughput sequencing experiments. Common features associated with miRNA binding and target downregulation have been identified and used to predict miRNA targets with machine learning methods. miRDB hosts predicted miRNA targets in five species: human, mouse, rat, dog and chicken. Users may also provide their own sequences for custom target prediction using the updated prediction algorithm. In addition, through combined computational analyses and literature mining, functionally active miRNAs in humans and mice were identified. These miRNAs, as well as associated functional annotations, are presented in the FuncMir Collection in miRDB.

It comes in the form of a decision tree leading to a set of potentially appropriate visualizations to represent the dataset. The project is built on two underlying philosophies. First, that most data analysis can be summarized in about twenty different dataset formats. Second, that both data and context determine the appropriate chart. Thus, From Data to Viz suggested method consists in identifying and trying all feasible chart types to find out which suits your data and idea best. Once this set of graphics is identified, From Data to Viz aims to guide you toward the best decision. It also provides a list of common caveats to avoid and always provides a reproducible code snippet in the R programming language. Dataviz is a world with endless possibilities and this project does not claim to be exhaustive. However, it should provide you with a good starting point.\nThe R CHARTS web site has been created without any financial support by José Carlos Soage.

PDBj’s logo design incorporates cytochrome c (PDBID: 1cyc), which was the first structure determined in Japan.\nElectron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) The Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) is a public repository for electron cryo-microscopy volume maps and tomograms of macromolecular complexes and subcellular structures. It covers a variety of techniques, including single-particle analysis, electron tomography, and electron crystallography. EMDB was founded at EMBL-EBI in 2002 under the leadership of Kim Henrick. From 2007, the archive has been operated jointly by EMBL-EBI and the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB). In 2013, the Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj) also became involved in EMDB. As of the first of January, 2021, EMDB is an archive operated under the aegis of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), and has also joined that organisation as a full member.\nResults of cryo-EM studies are archived in three collaborating archives:\nEMDB stores the processed 3D volumes and tomograms. EMDB stores the processed 3D volumes and tomograms. EMPIAR (Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive) stores the raw EM data underpinning the data in EMDB/PDB. Data for EMDB and PDB can be deposited through the wwPDB deposition and annotation system OneDep. EMPIAR is a companion archive to EMDB, founded at and operated by EMBL-EBI, and with a mirror site at PDBj.\nBMRB BMRB collects, annotates, archives, and disseminates spectral and quantitative data derived from NMR spectroscopic investigations of biological macromolecules and metabolites. BMRB makes bio-NMR data FAIR, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable.\nEMDataResource Cryo electron microscopy enables the determination of 3D structures of macromolecular complexes …","date":1501891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501891200,"objectID":"6b360eeea8918c204e2ab23b9150827a","permalink":"https://lbmii.github.io/resources/database/wwpdb/","publishdate":"2017-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/database/wwpdb/","section":"resources","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Universal protein data bank","type":"resources"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Softwares","Structural Biology"],"content":"The Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 (CCP4) in Protein Crystallography was set up in 1979 to support collaboration between researchers working on such software in the UK, and to assemble a comprehensive collection of software to satisfy the computational requirements of the relevant UK groups. The results of this effort gave rise to the CCP4 program suite, which is distributed to academic and commercial users world-wide. CCP4 was initially supported by the UK Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC), and currently by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). The project is hosted by the Scientific Computing Department of STFC at its Rutherford Laboratory. Missoins of CCP4 include:\nprovides and supports an integrated suite of programs for determination of macromolecular structures by X-ray crystallography aims to develop cutting edge approaches to experimental determination and analysis of protein structure as a community based resource, supports the development and integration of novel software into the suite serves the widest possible research community, embracing academic (not for profit) and for profit research offers education and training of scientists in experimental structural biology and encourages the wide dissemination of new ideas, techniques and practice Phaser is a program for phasing macromolecular crystal structures with maximum likelihood methods. It has been developed by Randy Read’s group at the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research (CIMR) in the University of Cambridge and is available through the Phenix and CCP4 software suites.\nPhenix is a highly automated software system for macromolecular structure determination. It can rapidly provide an initial partial model of a structure without significant human intervention, given moderate resolution and good quality data. This is thanks to the development of new algorithms for maximum-likelihood molecular replacement (Phaser), heavy-atom search (HySS), template and pattern-based automated model-building (Resolve), and automated macromolecular refinement (phenix.refine). These algorithms are based on a comprehensive set of crystallographic libraries available to the community (cctbx). The algorithms are easily accessible to users through the Phenix GUI and the command line. Phenix can do everything SOLVE/RESOLVE can do, plus much more. It is a fully integrated system for solving structures by MIR/MAD/SAD (using SOLVE and HYSS) or molecular replacement (using Phaser), density modification (using RESOLVE) and iterative model-building and refinement (using RESOLVE and phenix.refine). Plus Phenix has many terrific tools including Xtriage for analysis of datasets, elbow for generation of restraints, find_helices_strands for quick identification of secondary structure in a model, resolve_trace for multi-crystal averaging, and much more!\nSHELX is a set of programs for the determination of small (SM) and macromolecular (MM) crystal structures by single crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction. These stand-alone executables require NO libraries, extra files or environment variables. They are compatible with all modern versions of Linux, Windows and MacOSX, and are free for academic use. For-profit users are expected to pay a licence fee that covers development and support for all users.\nCoot, standing for Crystallographic Object-Oriented Toolkit, is for macromolecular model building, model completion and validation, particularly suitable for protein modelling using X-ray data. Coot displays maps and models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers, Ramachandran plots, skeletonization, non-crystallographic symmetry and more.\nThe flagship software, HKL-2000, has been used by over 100 pharmaceutical companies and over 1200 academic, governmental, and non-profit institutions. The software is also available at many synchrotron beam lines. The paper describing this software has over 30,000 citations in leading scientific journals and is 23rd among the top 100 most frequently cited scientific papers of all time. It has been reported to be used in the structure determination process in over 50% of all X-ray crystallography structures deposited to the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The HKL-3000 software combines all functions of the HKL-2000 program with a number of other macromolecular crystallographic computer programs: CCP4 suite, the ARP/wARP suite, the SHELX-97 suite, the SOLVE/RESOLVE suite, Coot, PyMOL and Buccaneer. Over 550 published papers reported the use of HKL-3000 .\nHKL2MAP is a graphical user-interface for macromolecular phasing. Running as a Tcl/Tk client, it is platform-independent, and in combination with the SHELX software it can be used on Linux as well as MacOS X platforms.

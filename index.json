We aim to discover the involvement of RNA molecules in regulatory networks controlling protein production and we are interested in understanding mechanisms whose alteration lead to aberrant aggregation, such as the one observed in amyloid diseases. We have recently observed that interaction between proteins and RNAs induce feedback loops that are crucial in protein homeostasis.

Based on the big data and cloud computing technologies, it provides data services such as archive, analysis, knowledge search, management authorization, and visualization.\nThe National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. Probably, PubMed, Entrez, and GEO are the most frequently used sub-databases.\nGene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is one part of NCBI and a public functional genomics data repository supporting MIAME-compliant data submissions. Array- and sequence-based data are accepted. Tools are provided to help users query and download experiments and curated gene expression profiles. With GEO, users can also analyze published data to identify genes that are differentially expressed across experimental conditions with GEO2R, where codes and scripts are no longer needed any more.\nThe BioStudies database holds descriptions of biological studies, links to data from these studies in other databases at EMBL-EBI or outside, as well as data that do not fit in the structured archives at EMBL-EBI. The database accepts submissions via an online tool, or in a simple tab-delimited format. It also enables authors to submit supplementary information and link to it from the publication. As a part of the BioStudies database, ArrayExpress, the functional genomics collection, stores data from high-throughput functional genomics experiments, and provides data for reuse to the research community. In line with community guidelines, a study typically contains metadata such as detailed sample annotations, protocols, processed data and raw data. Raw sequence reads from high-throughput sequencing studies are brokered to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and links are provided to download the sequence reads from ENA. Data can be submitted to the ArrayExpress collection through its dedicated submission tool, Annotare.\nEnsembl is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. Ensembl annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data. Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species. Ensembl is part of the ELIXIR Core Data Resources. You can click to see more about ELIXIR.\nThe UCSC Genome Browser is a web-based tool serving as a multi-powered microscope that allows researchers to view all 23 chromosomes of the human genome at any scale from a full chromosome down to an individual nucleotide. The browser integrates the work of countless scientists in laboratories worldwide, including work generated at UCSC, in an interactive, graphical display. The Browser also affords access to the genomes of more than one hundred other organisms.\nThe goal of the GENCODE project is to identify and classify all gene features in the human and mouse genomes with high accuracy based on biological evidence, and to release these annotations for the benefit of biomedical research and genome interpretation.\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a landmark cancer genomics program, molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types. This joint effort between NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute began in 2006, bringing together researchers from diverse disciplines and multiple institutions. Usually, we prefer to access the Database via Genomic Data Commons Data Portal. Other similar databases may also helpful, such as cBioPortal, GEPIA, UCSC Xena and Broad GDAC.\nThe Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium is an ongoing international collaboration of research groups funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The goal of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active. ENCODE investigators employ a variety of assays and methods to identify functional elements. The discovery and annotation of gene elements is accomplished primarily by sequencing a diverse range of RNA sources, comparative genomics, integrative bioinformatic methods, and human curation. Regulatory elements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays of DNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA and RNA, i.e., modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and RNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing.\nNONCODE is an integrated knowledge database dedicated to non-coding RNAs (excluding tRNAs and rRNAs).
